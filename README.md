# Final Project: Finch Robot Challenge

## Essential Question
How can we apply object-oriented programming principles and Java concepts to create interactive, autonomous robot behaviors that solve real-world challenges?

## Project Overview
In this project-based learning experience, you will program a Finch 2.0 robot to perform one of three challenges:
1. Choreograph a dance routine (with movement, lights, and sound)
2. Create an artistic drawing using the robot's movements
3. Navigate a maze autonomously

Your program must demonstrate your understanding of Java programming concepts from APCSA and object-oriented design principles while creating an engaging robot behavior.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply Java programming concepts in a physical computing context
- Implement object-oriented design principles
- Develop problem-solving skills through algorithm development
- Create well-documented and maintainable code
- Practice technical communication through presentations and documentation 

## Choice of Design
We chose the dance challenge. We wanted our finch to play a few notes, change colors on the tail, have a colored beak, and do a dance. We used for-loops and arrays to make the finch dance and play different notes. 

## Challenges
We struggled with getting the project started because it the format is of the website is new and unfamiliar. It was confusing to navigate around the website, but playing around with the code and testing out new tools helped up get familiar with it. We also had a hard time playing a song because the notes had to be created individually, so instead, we chose to play a set of notes and created our own note pattern. 

## Future Enhancements
If we had more time to work on this project, we would have tried to find a way to create an actual song with the notes. We would also have made the code shorter and less redundant to make the code cleaner, but more complex.
